## Starting up the Express Server: 

```
1. Download node.js if you don't have it
2. npm install
3. npm install nodemon -g
4. nodemon app.js
```

## Opening a visualization

The visualizations within the `visualization` folder expect csv files to be served from the Express server.
They expect the Express server to be running on Port: `3000`, which will be its default if you have not setup an environment variable.
